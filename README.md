## 📈 Key Insights & Recommendations
- **Home Appliances Lead in Revenue Potential**  
  Categories like **Home Appliances** and **Kitchen Tools** generated the **highest potential revenue**, driven by higher prices and a good number of reviews.  
   *Recommendation: These categories are strong candidates for expanded inventory and advertising investment.*

  -  **50%+ Discounts Don’t Always Boost Ratings**  
  Analysis showed **no consistent pattern** between high discounts and high product ratings. Some heavily discounted items still had poor reviews.  
   *Recommendation: Focus on product quality and customer satisfaction over aggressive discounting.*

-  **₹200–₹500 Price Range Dominates**  
  Most products fall in this price range, but those priced above ₹500 tend to have better average ratings.  
   *Recommendation: Explore upselling strategies for premium products and highlight value in listings.*
